# Clinicore

Generic clinic / practice management and digital prescription system.
Django + HTMX. Public repo, MIT licensed, also serves as a portfolio piece.

## Read this first

Read `docs/SPEC.md` in full before doing anything in this repo. It is the
single source of truth for stack, architecture, domain model, scope, and
delivery phases. Follow the working agreement in §0.

## Current status

MVP sprint, phases suspended

## Standing rules

- Propose before you build: approach, files you'll touch, then wait.
- Small increments. Never generate the whole app in one pass.
- I am an experienced Python/Django/Postgres engineer — skip the basics.
  Frontend (HTMX/Alpine/Tailwind) and deployment are my weak spots; explain
  those briefly as you go.
- Nothing specialty-specific (homeopathy, dental, etc.) in code. Configuration
  and seed data only.
- No new dependency without asking. No scope beyond the current phase.
- Never commit real patient data, real clinic branding, or a `.env` file.
- Tests and CI stay green. Run `ruff` and `pytest` before declaring work done.

## Code conventions

These are permanent and apply to every phase. `ruff` enforces the mechanical
ones; the rest are on you.

- **No `from __future__ import annotations`.** Target is Python 3.12. For a
  self-referencing return annotation use `typing.Self`, not a string literal.
  (`ruff` rule `UP010` catches the import.)
- **Single quotes for Python strings.** Docstrings stay `"""`. Enforced by
  `quote-style = "single"` in `[tool.ruff.format]` and `flake8-quotes` in
  `[tool.ruff.lint]` — both must stay set, or `ruff format` reverts the codebase
  on the next run.
- **Concise docstrings.** One or two lines per function, a short module
  docstring. Substantive rationale — why an approach was chosen, what was
  rejected, what the failure modes are — belongs in `docs/adr/`, referenced by
  filename from the code. Don't delete the reasoning; move it.
- **Keep module public APIs small.** Export the smallest surface that does the
  job and declare it in `__all__`. If a helper only exists so one caller can
  avoid a `with` block, it shouldn't be public.

## Commands

```bash
docker compose up                                     # local stack (web :8000, db :5433)
docker compose exec web python -m pytest
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker compose exec web python manage.py bootstrap_demo --reset   # synthetic demo data
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
python manage.py check
```

Outside Docker the project runs on SQLite (`POSTGRES_DB` unset) against the
`.venv_clinicore` virtualenv. `make seed` and a `Makefile` do not exist yet.
